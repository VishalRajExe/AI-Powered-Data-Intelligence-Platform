# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Proxy latency tracking** — the average latency EMA now seeds with the first observed sample instead of blending it against a zero baseline, which had caused a proxy's first request to be recorded at ~20% of its true latency (`server/internal/proxy/pool.go`)

## v0.1.1 (2026-03-20)

### Added
- **Anonymous telemetry** — event-level usage telemetry with hourly batch reporting (opt-out: `TELEMETRY=off`). See [TELEMETRY.md](TELEMETRY.md)
- **Transparency endpoint** — `GET /v1/telemetry/status` shows exactly what telemetry data will be sent
- **Startup banner notice** — telemetry status displayed on server boot
- **Privacy documentation** — `TELEMETRY.md` details what is and isn't collected

## v0.1.0 (2026-03-18)

Initial open-source release.
